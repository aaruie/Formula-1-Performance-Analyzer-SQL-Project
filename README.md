# Formula 1 Performance Analyzer using SQL

![Formula 1 logo](https://github.com/aaruie/Formula-1-Performance-Analyzer-SQL-Project/blob/main/F1_App_Red_Logo_White_Background.avif)

## OVERVIEW

The Formula 1 Performance Analyzer is a data analytics project that uses advanced SQL to extract and analyze actionable insights from historical Formula 1 race data from the 2020 to 2024 seasons. By simulating a real-world motorsport analytics environment, this project demonstrates how data can be used to inform strategic decisions for racing teams, race engineers, and sponsors. The project focuses on applying sophisticated SQL techniques‚Äîincluding aggregations, window functions, and time-series analysis‚Äîto uncover performance patterns and competitive advantages that go beyond simple race results.

## OBJECTIVE

- Driver Performance Analysis: Assess driver consistency and adaptability by examining metrics like qualifying vs. race pace and points scored, especially in light of the 2022 regulation changes.
- Pit-Stop Efficiency: Measure and compare the speed of pit stops across different teams to identify the most efficient crews and analyze how pit-stop performance impacts a race's final outcome. .
- Constructor Strategy Deconstruction: Uncover team-specific strategies by correlating race results with factors like tire choice and development trends, highlighting shifts in the competitive landscape.
- Causal Race Factors: Identify key variables, such as safety cars, overtakes, and incidents, that influence a driver's final position in a race.

## DATASET

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
 - Dataset : [Formula 1 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020)
