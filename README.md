## OVERVIEW
The Formula 1 Performance Analyzer is a data analytics project that uses advanced SQL to extract and analyze actionable insights from historical Formula 1 race data from the 2020 to 2024 seasons. By simulating a real-world motorsport analytics environment, this project demonstrates how data can be used to inform strategic decisions for racing teams, race engineers, and sponsors. The project focuses on applying sophisticated SQL techniques—including aggregations, window functions, and time-series analysis—to uncover performance patterns and competitive advantages that go beyond simple race results.
